<p>My virtual scene is a combination of 3D figuration scanned and uploaded from qlone, free 3D image from yobi3D free uploads, as well as shapes combined from meshmix. All of these images were collaged together and reshaped and contoured through meshmix before then uploading to sketchfab and continuing to manipulte the 3D structures even more. This included a major play on displacement, which also included involving an upoad of further textures to change the dispalcement, and create the clusture of 3D images into an extremeley different stratosphere where they belong together. Taking the reality of existing sculptures, making them a virtual 3D image and then creating a more natural sort of texture through manipulation of the digital effects in order to try and create a more natural texture and color scheme between them within a new world of their own. I was going for a sort of intergalactic point of view from perspective in terms of field of view, especially in the saved view I have it set in. From this particualr perspective it reminds me of sort of flying through outer space and witnessing a new galaxy of it's own, made of different textures, colors and geometric shapes. The darker purplish background is sort of static and movement in space trying to create an atmosphere the galaxy is floating within.
